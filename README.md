# Eagle Factions Remake
The idea of this remake is to create a plugin **for sponge** which looks and (sort of) feels like massivecraft factions.
On top of that, it will have extra features like an enhanced permissions system.


#####Currently working on
 * Better save mechanics. It will have the same saving as Mcclans which also means it will have **database support**!

#####Top Priority
 * Add commands for permissions
 * Add permissions for allies
 * Add user friendly /f promote and /f demote
 * Write permissions documentation
 * Remove references to PluginMessages.java (***No one really used the translation feature and its a pain to maintain***)

#####Ideas
 * Make factions chat a separate plugin?

# Original readme: 


## Goals
 * Finish up TODOs left in the code
 * Add factions permissions and **Custom ranks in factions**
   * Maybe add advanced mode which is effectively pex (Always allow /f leave though)
 * Fix massive corruption issues and lag from saving
 * Remove tags (low priority)
 * Maybe add deal with the devil type situations (ex: double power but no protection while members are online)
 * Make join back a thing!
   * Maybe /f templeave for member+ and still be able to rejoin without losing faction data like rank or titles. Also make it easier to do if your the only one online.
 * Make friendly fire a permission, not a flag (what could possibly go wrong)
 * Add faction titles
 * Anything else that does not take much work which I happen to think of while in the shower!


## General
Eagle Faction is a factions/war plugin for SpongeForge. You can simply create factions and claim territories by using "power". Yes! Power! Just like in the original factions plugin made for Bukkit (and Spigot).

Eagle Factions will change your minecraft experience forever. We offer you a new gameplay with some extra cool features that will change your gameplay. Land protection while faction is offline, possiblity to destroy enemy factions, custom ranks, and many more.

Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/Aquerr/EagleFactions/wiki) to get to know how everything works.
